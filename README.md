# XeroxDash
Empowering the Customers with Real-Time Tracking and Easy Documents Submission

# Project Document: XeroxDash
# Introduction
The XeroxDash project is a comprehensive document management and workflow automation system designed to streamline document-related processes within organizations. This document provides an overview of the project, its problem statement, proposed solution, users, architecture, design, and future enhancements.

# Project Description
XeroxDash aims to revolutionize the way organizations handle documents, reducing manual work, improving efficiency, and enhancing collaboration. It encompasses features such as document storage, retrieval, version control, and automated workflows.

# Problem Statement
Traditional document management processes are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack collaboration capabilities. XeroxDash addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform for managing documents and automating associated workflows.

# Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a web-based application using the Spring Boot framework that offers a user-friendly interface for document management, version control, and workflow automation. Users can upload, edit, collaborate, and automate processes related to documents seamlessly.

# Users
XeroxDash caters to a diverse set of users, including:
Administrators: Responsible for system configuration and user management.
Employees: Regular users who create, upload, and manage documents.
Managers: Oversee document approval workflows.
Auditors: Monitor document access and changes.

Controller Layer: Manages incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates business logic. Annotated with @RestController or @Controller.
Service Layer: Contains business logic, connects with repositories, and handles complex tasks. Annotated with @Service.
Repository Layer: Offers data access and persistence, communicates with databases (relational or NoSQL), and streamlines CRUD operations. Utilizes Spring Data modules.
Model Layer: Represents data entities, corresponds to database tables or collections, and uses tools like JPA or Hibernate with annotations like @Entity and @Table for mapping.
